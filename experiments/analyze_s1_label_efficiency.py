"""S1 -- label-efficiency curves on cached mu. Roadmap 2026-08-25 stretch row S1 (provenance YM-W6).

THE QUESTION. W6 says a "semi-supervised" claim has to be paid for in label reduction: "如果claim是semi
supervised，那就是看能减少多少有label的数据的使用". F1 measured the fusion advantage
(`features (+) mu` over `features`) at ONE point on the label axis -- 100 % of the train split. S1 asks
whether that advantage GROWS as the label budget shrinks, which is the only version of the claim that
supports the semi-supervised framing as a figure. The paper's claim (D16/D19) does not change either
way; this is a supporting panel, and a flat or reversed curve prints exactly as honestly.

PRE-REGISTERED EXPECTATION, fixed before any score was read:
    S1-E1  the fusion delta at each task's SMALLEST admissible label budget exceeds its delta at full n
           by more than the seed-paired 2*SE, on >= 6 of the 11 tasks
           --> "the frozen representation is worth more when labels are scarce", the W6 panel works.
    S1-E2  otherwise --> report the widen/flat/narrow split verbatim. ML4PS welcomes nulls (tips T6).

WHAT THIS REUSES RATHER THAN RE-DERIVES. `analyze_exp10_fe_subsample.py` already established the
subsampling estimator (stratified star-level draws, test set never touched, encoder-seed spread and
draw spread reported side by side and never merged); this script generalises it from 3 tasks x 2 arms
to 11 x 5. The arm tables come from `analyze_f1_fusion_scorecard.pool`/`concat` verbatim, so the inputs
to every readout are bit-identical to F1's, and the FULL-BUDGET row of this script is therefore not a
new measurement at all -- it must reproduce `f1_absolute.csv` exactly. That is gate FOOTING-1 below.

THE LADDER (user decision 2026-09-01). The roadmap sketched fractions {1, 10, 100} %. A fraction means
20x different label counts across these tasks (1 % is 160 stars for `osc_giant` and 8 for
`rgb_vs_heb`), so the grid is the UNION of the fraction ladder and an absolute-count ladder:
    fractions  {1, 3, 10, 30, 100} % of the task's own eligible TRAIN set
    absolute   {50, 100, 300, 1000, 3000} training stars
deduped, capped at the task's n_train. The roadmap's pre-registered {1, 10, 100} % points are contained
exactly, and the figure plots on absolute n so the curves are comparable across tasks.

THE FLOOR (pre-registered, user decision 2026-09-01, fixed BEFORE any score was read):
    admissible cell  <-->  n_train >= 50  AND  (regression, or n_train_pos >= 10)
The n_train clause is about the readout, not the labels: the fusion arm has 25 + 128 = 153 columns, and
below ~50 rows the fit is degenerate whatever the prevalence. Inadmissible cells are NOT scored, and
the CSV records why. Measured consequence at 1 %: `transit` (6 pos), `ijspeert` (4), `rotation` (8),
`eb` (9), `rgb_vs_heb` (8 stars), `rotation_period` (7 stars) drop out; all 11 tasks are admissible at
3 % and above.

ARMS (5), one readout (`mean`), one readout family (`linear`) -- the F1 headline cell:
    features_only               the A1 engineered ceiling. Arm-independent and seedless.
    mu                          hann0p3_fbwd seeds 0-5.
    features_plus_mu            hann0p3_fbwd seeds 0-5. THE HEADLINE ARM.
    mu / features_plus_mu       under `untrained`, the capacity-matched dilution control at every budget.
The dyn-off arm is deliberately absent: `delta(fbwd) - delta(off)` is a second story and would double
the runtime of a one-panel figure.

THE `cvC` CONTROL (added 2026-09-01, AFTER the fixedC curves were read -- said plainly rather than
back-dated). The fixedC result splits 9-2 along the readout, not along the task: all nine
classification probes use `LogisticRegression(C=1.0)`, whose penalty strength does NOT depend on n,
and all nine lose their fusion advantage at small budgets; both regression probes use `RidgeCV`, whose
alpha IS chosen by leave-one-out CV at every budget, and both keep a positive delta down to 50 and 67
training stars. So "the fusion advantage is a large-label phenomenon" has an alternative reading --
"a readout with n-independent regularisation overfits 153 columns on few rows" -- and the two are not
separable in the fixedC table. `--readout cvC` swaps ONE knob (C chosen by cross-validation, sklearn's
default `Cs=10` grid, everything else held identical) and re-runs the nine classification probes.
    control confirms  collapse survives an adapting penalty --> the negative is about LABELS.
    control refutes   collapse disappears --> the fixedC curve measured a hyperparameter, and S1's
                      headline is that finding, not the label-efficiency one.
Reported BESIDE the frozen headline and never replacing it (the C3b precedent); the linear-probe lock
in CLAUDE.md governs the headline probe, which this does not touch.

POPULATION. S1 inherits F1's populations unchanged -- the v1 packed subset (9,428 / 2,021 stars) and
the new-task pool (16,002 / 3,429). Both are CASE-CONTROL, so every prevalence here is inflated
relative to a survey; R8 measured absolutes falling 60-71 % under `survey_matched`. Deltas keep their
sign under that reweighting and magnitudes do not (R8), so no absolute score in this table transfers to
a survey population. Carried on every row as `population_note`.

FLARE. Scored with F1's label set (`flare_ever` via `new_task_scorecard.label_frame`), NOT L1's
corrected 2x2. It stays UNPRINTABLE until L1's visual gate lands (STATUS 2026-08-26d, reporting rule
B), so its rows carry printable=False and it is excluded from the S1-E1 count.

ESTIMATOR CONVENTIONS THAT BIND:
  - subsample the TRAIN split only, at STAR level, stratified (binary label, or target quartile for the
    two regressions). The test set is byte-identical at every budget, so n_test / n_test_pos reproduce
    F1's published values at every point on the curve -- gate FOOTING-2.
  - the draw index is shared across ALL FIVE ARMS within a cell, so a delta is differenced on identical
    rows and the draw noise cancels.
  - two spreads, side by side, never merged: seed spread (average over draws first, then sd over the 6
    encoder seeds) is the headline error bar, matching every other table in this project; draw spread
    (average over seeds first, then sd over draws) is reported beside it.
  - the full-budget level has nothing to resample AND a deterministic readout, so it runs one draw and
    the CSV says so. Its draw spread is 0 by construction, not by measurement.

Run (repo root, swm env, PYTHONPATH=src; CPU-only, ~25 min at --jobs 10):
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python experiments/analyze_s1_label_efficiency.py
    python experiments/analyze_s1_label_efficiency.py --tasks eb --draws 3 --seeds 0
    python experiments/analyze_s1_label_efficiency.py --summary-only
    python experiments/analyze_s1_label_efficiency.py --rotation-pool    # the two rotation tasks on pool 3

ROTATION POOL (added 2026-10-05). The paper now scores `rotation` and `rotation_period` on pool 3
(experiments/rotation_pool: the 106,284 corpus stars outside the subset, natural prevalence), so their
label-efficiency curves are re-measured there with `--rotation-pool`: same ladder, floor, draws and
readouts, mu and features read from the R8 caches, the untrained control = `untrained_i0` (the paper's
single untrained arm). Its footing gates check against experiments/rotation_pool/ rather than F1, and it
writes to experiments/rotation_pool/s1 so the subset curves above stay untouched.

    what its axis says. TWO clauses, because the arithmetic is exactly reproducible for one arm and not
    for the others:

    1a EXACT, |diff| < 1e-9, on the `features_only` arm. 25 well-conditioned columns and a
       deterministic logistic fit: this is the clause that actually tests the population, the keep
       masks and the feature table, and it has no numerical excuse available to it.
    1b BOUNDED, |diff| < 5e-3, on the mu-bearing arms. These carry 128 or 153 columns and the lbfgs
       solve is ill-conditioned enough that the BLAS thread count changes the fitted coefficients (see
       the pinning block at the top of this file). S1 runs single-threaded throughout; F1 did not, so a
       residual is EXPECTED here and its size is reported rather than assumed. Measured 2026-09-01: 29
       of 55 rows exact, 45 under 1e-4, max 1.0e-3 on untrained/features_plus_mu -- the most
       ill-conditioned cell in the table, which is the ordering the mechanism predicts. This is the
       same class of term F1 already recorded for its two mu caches (3.5e-4 from cuDNN nondeterminism,
       moving 6-seed PR-AUC by <= 1e-4).

    IT DOES NOT TOUCH ANY S1-INTERNAL COMPARISON. Every cell on every curve is fitted in the same
